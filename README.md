# ICMadness

Welcome to ICMadness. As final project season approaches, you may feel the weight of coming up with a "big" "important" idea feels heavy at times. Today is about doing the opposite. Create a project based on random instructions from a bot. What can you do in 2 hours as a collaboration of three random ICM students with three random things (action, technology, topic) put together? The inspiration behind the project generator bot is the [Art Assignment Bot](https://twitter.com/artassignbot).
